## Overview

This project was completed as part of a Data Science Bootcamp by the **RocketScience Team**, consisting of three members. The goal of the project was to analyze **employee attrition** and explore various factors influencing whether employees leave a company, including job satisfaction, promotion opportunities, and demographic factors.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle - Employee Attrition and Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors). It contains data on 1,470 employees working in a medical research organization, including both current and former employees. The aim was to understand what drives employee departures and analyze various aspects of the company's operations like salary distribution, gender equality, and career advancement opportunities.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to explore the following key questions:
- What factors contribute to employee attrition?
- Does the opportunity for career advancement affect retention rates?
- How do employee demographics (such as gender, age, marital status, etc.) impact the likelihood of leaving the company?

## Stakeholders

The **HR department** was the main stakeholder in this project. They sought insights into:
- The reasons employees leave the company.
- Identifying employees at risk due to a lack of promotions or other factors.
- Exploring ways to reduce attrition and improve employee satisfaction.

## Key Findings

- **Salary and Gender Equality:** There is pay equality between men and women for the same roles. Salaries increase with seniority.
- **Promotion Opportunities:** The company offers substantial promotion opportunities, with 75% of employees not staying in the same role for more than two years.
- **Employee Benefits:** All employees have equal access to benefits, contributing to fairness within the organization.
- **Employee Retention:** The company enjoys strong employee engagement with an average employee tenure of 7 years. Half of the employees have been with the company for 5 years or more.
- **Attrition Trends:** The average attrition rate is 16%, with noticeable variations based on age, marital status, and distance from home.
- **Impact of Education:** Employees with degrees in HR, marketing, or technical fields tend to change jobs more frequently, leading to higher attrition rates among those groups.

## Personal Analysis Focus

In addition to the overall analysis, I focused on understanding how **personal life factors** (such as marital status and distance from home) influence an employee's decision to leave the company. Key insights include:
- **Age Groups:** Employees aged 18-21 have the highest attrition rate at 53.66%, while attrition decreases with age.
- **Marital Status:** Single employees tend to have higher attrition rates compared to married or divorced employees. For example, 23.62% of single women left the company, compared to 11.40% of married women.
- **Distance from Home:** Employees who left the company had an average commute of 10.6 miles, whereas those who stayed had an average commute of 9.2 miles.
- **Business Travel:** The majority (71%) of employees rarely travel for business, and frequent business travel (19%) appears to have minimal effect on attrition.
- **Education Level:** Employees with lower levels of education are more likely to leave the company, suggesting that education plays a role in retention.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that the company in question provides a fair, supportive, and equitable environment for its employees. Opportunities for career advancement, fair pay practices, and employee benefits contribute to relatively low attrition rates, particularly for older employees or those in higher roles. However, younger employees and those with certain educational backgrounds exhibit higher attrition rates, which suggests areas where HR might focus on improving retention strategies.
